	<h1> Hello Fellas </h1>
	<h2> It's important to use h1 h2 h3 (etc.) because it is used by the digitally impaired</h2>
	<h3> Screen readers can read a web page, but only if the designer uses semantic coding</h3>
	<h6> Don't be shitty. Be inclusive.</h6>
	<p>You keep saying you got something for me
	Something you call love but confess
	You've been a'messin' where you shouldn't 've been a'messin'
	And now someone else is getting all your best</p>
	<p>These boots are made for walking
	And that's just what they'll do
	One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
	You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
	You keep losing when you oughta not bet </p>
	<p>You keep samin' when you oughta be a'changin'
	Now what's right is right but you ain't been right yet
	These boots are made for walking
	And that's just what they'll do
	One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you</p>
